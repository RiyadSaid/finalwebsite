        <p>Pokémon Red Version and Pokémon Blue Version are 1996 role-playing video games (RPGs) developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy. They are the first installments of the Pokémon video game series. They were first released in Japan in 1996 as Pocket Monsters Red and Pocket Monsters Green, with the special edition Pocket Monsters Blue released in Japan later that year. The games were released as Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue in North America and Australia in 1998 and Europe in 1999. Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue combined Red, Green and Blue for release outside of Japan.</p>
        <p>Pokémon Yellow Version: Special Pikachu Edition, often referred to as simply Pokémon Yellow, is an enhanced version released in Japan in 1998 and in other regions in 1999 and 2000. Remakes of Red and Green, Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, were released for the Game Boy Advance in 2004, while remakes of Yellow, Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! were released for the Nintendo Switch in 2018. Red, Blue, and Yellow–in addition to Green in Japan–were rereleased on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console service on Nintendo eShop as emulated versions, in 2016 as a commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary.</p>
