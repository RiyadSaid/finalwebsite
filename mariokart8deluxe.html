        <p>Mario Kart 8 is a 2014 kart racing game developed and published by Nintendo for the Wii U. It retains the gameplay of previous games in the Mario Kart series, with players controlling a Mario franchise character in races around tracks. Tracks are themed around locales from the Super Mario platform series and are populated with power-ups that help players gain advantages in races. Different difficulties are selectable prior to a race; harder difficulties make gameplay faster. In the new anti-gravity sequences, players drive on walls and ceilings. Mario Kart 8 contains a variety of single-player and local and online multiplayer games modes, including Grand Prix racing and arena-based battle modes.</p>
        <p>Nintendo revealed Mario Kart 8 in 2013, and released it in May 2014. Both paid and free downloadable content (DLC) were released after its launch, including a further difficulty setting and additional tracks. It was re-released on the Nintendo Switch in April 2017 as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Deluxe includes all of the original DLC, as well as a revamped battle mode and other gameplay alterations. Nintendo continued to add downloadable circuits and characters as paid DLC.</p>
