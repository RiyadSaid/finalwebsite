1. A problem I encountered in this unit was with making my spin wheel. Its code was very complex and there were times it didn't do what it was supposed to. I overcame it by figuring out alternative ways to implement my code, as well as fixing bugs.

Code snippet:

    .container .spinBtn {

    position: absolute; 
    width: 60px; 
    height: 60px; 
    background: #ffffff; 
    border-radius: 50%; 
    z-index: 10; 
    display: flex; 
    justify-content: center; 
    align-items: center; 
    text-transform: uppercase; 
    font-weight: 600; 
    color: #333; 
    letter-spacing: 0.1em; 
    border: 4px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.75); 
    cursor: pointer; 
    user-select: none; 
    font-size: 8px; 
    text-align: center;
    }
This code snippet is for the style of the spin button. It makes its shape, size, text, etc.


2. My understanding of computing has greatly expanded since the behinning of the semester. I relearned HTML, and learned CSS, C and Javascript.

3. New skills I learned include how to efficiently use C. At first I was very confused by it, but after a few assignments, I learned how to use it efficiently and almost fluently.

4. Computers improve our lives in ways such as storing data, having different programs for entertainment, work, education, etc, and creating many jobs.

5. If we removed computers from our lives, our lives would be improved in ways such as forcing people to be more active in the real world.

6. If I want to work in fields that use computer science, this class will have a meaningul impact on me in the future.
